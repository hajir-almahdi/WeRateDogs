#Analyzing Tweets from WeRateDogs twitter account for Udacity Nanodegree 

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, in this project data wrangling processes will be applied to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.

The dataset consits of the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10.

WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

In this project, Tweepy will be used to query Twitter's API for additional data beyond the data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. This additional data will include retweet count and favorite count.

Data wrangling in this project consists of:

    - Gathering data
    - Assessing data
    - Cleaning data

In addtion to storing, analyzing, and visualizing the wrangled data.
